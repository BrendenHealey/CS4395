## Course Assignments
### Overview
Here is an [overview of Natural Language Processing.](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) In it, I provide some information and answer questions about NLP.

### Assignment 1
This is my [first homework assignment.](https://github.com/BrendenHealey/CS4395/tree/main/Homework1) The instructions for this assignment are [available here.](Homework1/HW1_Instructions.pdf) The purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable in a python coding environment, gain experience in coding with python, and gain experience in writing python classes. We are expected to be able to code regular expressions, file I/O, and pickling.

### Assignment 2
This is my [second homework assignment.](ExploringNLTK.pdf) In this assignment, I explore the Natural Language Toolkit.

### Guessing Game
This is a [guessing game](https://github.com/BrendenHealey/CS4395/tree/main/GuessingGame) where a noun is taken at random from a list of 50 nouns, which have been processed from a given text. The player starts with 5 points. Each correct guess increases the score by 1 point, while each incorrect guess decreases the score by 1 point. If player has negative score, the game ends

### WordNet
My WordNet assignment is [available here](https://github.com/BrendenHealey/CS4395/tree/main/WordNet). This is a Jupyter notebook where I explore WordNet and SentiWordNet to understand the functionality and demonstrate basic skills.

### N-Grams (COMING SOON)
This is a program created with [my partner, Quy.](https://github.com/tqyn117) In this assignment we explore ngrams and calculate the probability of a sentence given a corpus of text.
